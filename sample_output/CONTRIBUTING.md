## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Our Cool Project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/user/slug/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <email@example.com>.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/user/slug/blob/master/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/user/slug/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

* Open an [Issue](https://github.com/user/slug/issues/new)
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
* Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in the description.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum
